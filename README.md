## Control Panel Template Kit

Control Panel Template Kit is an application based on laravel 10 framework, livewire 3 and SB Admin 2 graphic template. The main idea of the project is to be a simple admin panel with basic functionalities that can be useful in more complex projects. The project is built on several branches that separate functionalities. This way, they can be updated independently and only the ones we need can be included in a new project.
